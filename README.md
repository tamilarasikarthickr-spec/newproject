## Quickstart

### Option 1: Use the hosted version

The easiest way to get started - no setup required!

Visit **[bpmn-frontend.onrender.com](https://bpmn-frontend.onrender.com)** and provide your own API keys directly in the interface. Your keys are stored locally in your browser and never stored on any servers.

### Option 2: Run locally with Docker

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/jtlicardo/bpmn-assistant.git
```

```
cd bpmn-assistant
```

2. Set up your environment variables

<details>
<summary>Linux, macOS</summary>

```
cd src/bpmn_assistant
```

```
cp .env.example .env
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Windows</summary>

```
cd src\bpmn_assistant
```

```
copy .env.example .env
```

</details>

3. Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys.

4. Build and run the application

```
docker-compose up --build
```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`

## Prerequisites

At least one of the following API keys:
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart)
- [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- [Google AI Studio (Gemini) API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- [Fireworks AI API key](https://docs.fireworks.ai/getting-started/quickstart)

Note: You can use any combination of the API keys above, but at least one is required to use the app.

Additional prerequisites for local deployment:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Supported models

### OpenAI

* GPT-5
* GPT-5 mini
* GPT-4.1 (recommended)

### Anthropic

* Claude Sonnet 4.5 (recommended)
* Claude Opus 4.1

### Google

* Gemini 2.5 Flash
* Gemini 2.5 Pro (recommended)

### Fireworks AI

* Llama 4 Maverick
* Qwen 3 235B
* Deepseek V3.1 (recommended)

## Core features

1. **Diagram creation** - Generates BPMN diagrams based on text descriptions.
2. **Diagram editing** - Modifies BPMN diagrams based on user input.
3. **Diagram interpretation** - Provides text descriptions of BPMN diagrams.
4. **Drag-and-drop functionality** - Users can drag and drop BPMN files (containing only supported elements) into the
   editor, then ask the LLM to edit or explain the process.
5. **Vision support** - Upload images (flowcharts, sketches, diagrams) to create or modify BPMN processes. Currently available for OpenAI models only.

## Supported elements

The application currently supports a subset of BPMN elements:

### Tasks
* Task
* User task
* Service task
* Send task
* Receive task
* Business rule task
* Manual task
* Script task

### Gateways
* Exclusive gateway
* Parallel gateway
* Inclusive gateway

### Events
**Start events**
* Start event
* Timer start event
* Message start event

**End events**
* End event
* Message end event

**Intermediate events**
* Intermediate throw event (generic)
* Intermediate throw event (message)
* Intermediate catch event (generic)
* Intermediate catch event (timer)
* Intermediate catch event (message)

## Limitations

* The AI assistant does not "see" manual edits made to the diagram. It always responds based on its last generated
  version. Keep this in mind when interacting with the assistant after making manual changes.
* Pools and lanes are not supported due to limitations in the [BPMN Auto Layout](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-auto-layout) library.
